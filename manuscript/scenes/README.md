# Scene Drafts

Use this folder for rough scene drafts before incorporating them into chapters.

Example structure:
- scene_01_opening.md
- scene_04_confrontation.md
- alternate_ending_v1.md

## Tips
- Date your drafts
- Keep multiple versions if trying different approaches
- Move polished scenes into chapter files
