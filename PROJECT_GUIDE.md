## Claude Code Workflow Examples

### Starting a new chapter
```
"Based on my outline, draft chapter 4 where [brief description]"
```

### Character consistency
```
"Review chapters 1-5 and check if Sarah's character traits match her profile"
```

### Compilation
```
"Run compile_manuscript.py to create a single document"
```

### Analysis
```
"Run word_count.py and tell me which chapters need expansion"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit regularly** - Save your progress frequently
2. **Update character profiles** - Keep them current as characters develop
3. **Maintain the outline** - Update as your story evolves
4. **Use branches** - For experimental rewrites or alternate plotlines
5. **Track word counts** - Monitor progress toward your goal

## Tips for Long-Running Projects

- Set daily or weekly word count goals
- Review previous chapters before writing new ones
- Keep a "questions" document for plot issues to resolve
- Use tags or markers for sections needing revision
- Celebrate milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, complete!)
